# What is this repo for?

This repo is a hackathon platform that I am building on a twitch stream with a bunch of nerds talking in my chat. It was not my idea but I'm rolling with it because twitch streamer pleases the audience.

# Okay but what is this?

This is a platform where you can host hackathons by logging in via Twitch/Github/Youtube.

When you host a hackathon, people can see the hackathons that you've started if they follow you or are browsing hackathons.

As a participant, you can submit a project by putting in a github url. The platform will take your github url and make a docker image of it and then send it to a vps server to fire up.

We will return you a url where you can view your project live (assuming you have a working project).

More features incoming. Just wrote this to be helpful.
